Alongside the development of UX and UI elements for client use, we are also focused on packaging the platform for broader adoption. We have begun early testing with select partners to validate CVDE and trial core features of the I-CVDE platform. This phase is centered on real-world feedback, refinement, and strengthening the foundation as we prepare for a larger release. Notes on the results will follow in the coming weeks as we progress toward the end of 2025. In parallel, other platforms and integrations are advancing as expected, with CVDE remaining the primary focus of this phase.
Thank you,
