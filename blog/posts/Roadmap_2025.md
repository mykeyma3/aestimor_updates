Aestimor Platform Roadmap
Purpose
This roadmap outlines the development milestones of the Aestimor platform as it progresses toward general availability. It provides a high-level view of platform access, functionality, and the expected development framework.
While internal timelines and proprietary feature specifics remain confidential, this document reflects currently available information and may be updated as development continues.

Platform Context
Aestimor is being built for professionals in the architecture, engineering, construction (AEC), and lumber and building materials (LBM) industries. These sectors often rely on legacy platforms that fall short of modern performance standards, data practices, and cross-team collaboration needs.
Aestimor is purpose-built to address these gaps, delivering a modular, AI-supported environment designed to support the workflows and realities of distributed teams.

How to Track Progress
Ongoing updates are published at:

An official RSS feed will be introduced to support real-time access to announcements and release notes.
Questions can be submitted through the platform’s contact form. Select responses may be anonymized and shared publicly to benefit others with similar inquiries.

Roadmap Overview
Each development phase builds on the last—expanding capabilities, improving stability, and gradually broadening platform access.

Phase 1: Infrastructure and Early Access
Focus: Core systems, early module deployment, controlled onboarding
FMS3 – Flow and task coordination
CVDE – Data structuring and validation
CORE – Project routing and coordination
I-CVDE – Pattern recognition with AI assistance and human oversight
Introduction of token-based access
Pilot onboarding and structured feedback
Initial support documentation in development


Access is limited to select pilot users during this phase.

Phase 2: Workflow Expansion and System Integration
Focus: Multi-party collaboration and early integrations
Expanded task routing and coordination tools
Role-based access management
Initial integrations with third-party platforms
Announcement of user-facing applications
Enhanced administrative and usage tools


Users can expect clearer support for defined workflows and team roles.

Phase 3: Refinement and Ecosystem Development
Focus: Stability, documentation, and partner enablement
Case studies and early real-world use cases
Additional external integrations
Expanded documentation and user guidance
Initial partner ecosystem development


Access broadens to a wider set of organizations while remaining semi-private.

Phase 4: General Availability (GA)
Focus: Public access, onboarding, and scale
Public pricing for tokens and subscriptions
Defined storage and usage tiers
Self-service onboarding
Full support and documentation resources


Aestimor is considered production-ready for supported use cases at this stage.
