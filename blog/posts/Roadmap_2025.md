Aestimor Platform Roadmap

Purpose

The Aestimor Platform Roadmap outlines the platform’s development path toward general availability. It provides a high-level view of progress and priorities as the platform evolves to meet industry needs. While specific timelines and internal details remain confidential, this document reflects the current direction and goals of the Aestimor team.

Platform Overview

Aestimor is designed for professionals in the architecture, engineering, construction (AEC), and lumber and building materials (LBM) industries. These fields rely heavily on complex, often outdated systems that limit efficiency and collaboration. Aestimor addresses these challenges through a modern, modular platform that leverages AI-assisted workflows and supports distributed, data-driven teams.

Development Focus

Aestimor’s development is centered on three key objectives:
	1.	Performance and Reliability – Building a robust infrastructure capable of supporting complex, multi-user projects at scale.
	2.	Collaboration and Workflow Support – Enabling seamless coordination across roles, disciplines, and organizations through structured task management and data sharing.
	3.	Integration and Accessibility – Connecting with established tools and platforms while expanding self-service onboarding and documentation as the platform matures.
