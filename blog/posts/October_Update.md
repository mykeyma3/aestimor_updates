As October progresses, we’re pleased to share the latest updates on CVDE, our platform for document analysis, annotation, and collaboration in the construction and engineering industries. This month:

CVDE is now optimized as a secure, cross-platform desktop application for both Mac and Windows, offering users a seamless, native experience. Back-end enhancements have improved communication with cloud services.

User experience remains a priority, with continued UI and UX updates to simplify workflows and enhance accessibility. Testing with select partners continues to guide improvements and validate real-world functionality.

We’ve also reinforced the platform’s architecture for scalability and future integrations, ensuring CVDE remains adaptable as we grow.

As we enter the final months of 2025, our focus is on aligning the platform with real-world demands and preparing for broader adoption. We extend our gratitude to our partners and early testers for their feedback and support.

Best,
The Aestimor Development Team
